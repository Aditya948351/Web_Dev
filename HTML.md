<h1 align="center">HTML</h1>

<p>
  
  <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 </li>

  <li>HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. </li>

  <li>HTML file has extensions as ".html" or .htm"</li>

</p>
  <p>    
    <h2>What is Hyper-text ?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup language.' 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.</li>  
    </ul>
  </p>

<p><h2>Features of HTML</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.</li>
    <li>Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their website).</li>
    <li>HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.</li>
    <li>It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Let's have a look!</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Go to Google Chrome, open any website, and right-click on the webpage.</li>
  <li>Click on "Inspect".</li>
  <li>Now you will see the HTML code in the Elements section (Other sections are for JavaScript and CSS).</li>
